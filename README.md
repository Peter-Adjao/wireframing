# Introduction to Wireframing  

## What is Wireframing?  
Wireframing is the process of creating a **visual blueprint** of a website, application, or digital product. It outlines the **basic structure, layout, and functionality** of a design without focusing on colors, images, or detailed styling. Wireframes serve as a **skeleton** that represents the arrangement of elements such as navigation, buttons, content areas, and features.  

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process  
Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design and development process because it:  

- **Clarifies ideas** – helps designers and stakeholders visualize concepts before investing time in full design.  
- **Saves time and resources** – identifies potential issues early, reducing costly revisions later.  
- **Enhances collaboration** – provides a shared reference point for designers, developers, and clients.  
- **Focuses on user experience (UX)** – ensures the design meets user needs by emphasizing layout and usability over aesthetics.  

By creating wireframes, teams can **streamline communication, align expectations, and build a solid foundation** for successful product design.
